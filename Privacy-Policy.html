<h1 class="wow fadeInUp">Canary Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Canary (&ldquo;Canary&rdquo;, &quot;We&quot;) knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Canary&rsquo;s Services. To that end, in addition to this Privacy Policy, we have developed the following other documents that complement and are part of this policy, all of which describe the data we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices regarding your data:<br class="hidden-xs" />
<br class="hidden-xs" />
A &#39;Privacy 101&#39; page, a concise and easy to read way to learn about privacy on the Services and the guiding principles that inform how we develop the Services and the decisions we make; and<br class="hidden-xs" />
A set of FAQs related to privacy.<br class="hidden-xs" />
<br class="hidden-xs" />
This Privacy Policy covers Canary&rsquo;s treatment of personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot; ) and other data that Canary gathers when you are accessing Canary&rsquo;s Services. You can control how certain information is used and shared through our Services as described below.</p>

<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">What Personal Information Does Canary Collect?</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store information you enter on our Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, and location. We automatically receive your location when you use the Services. We use various technologies to determine location, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser and sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi- access points and cell towers. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Services, improving the content of the Services, customizing the advertising and content you and your friends see (including Canary or third-party advertising or content), and communicating with you about specials and new features. Your Services account will be associated with a Services ID, your email (when you log into the Services) and optionally a phone number, and this account will be used for all our Services that you use. Information you provide to one of our Services may be used with other Services you or your friends use. Additionally, if you use a Service without logging into that Service on a device and later log into a Service on that device, Canary will combine information that was collected about your use of the Service in a logged-out state with your Services account. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.<br class="hidden-xs" />
<br class="hidden-xs" />
Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Services, Canary automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, browser type, operating information, mobile carrier, device and application IDs, cookie information, information regarding your use of our Services and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Canary only uses this data in aggregate or anonymous form. We may provide aggregate or anonymous information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Services, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Services.</p>

<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">How is My Information Shared?</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We use your information in order to provide you with the Services and in a manner consistent with the disclosures in this Privacy Policy. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone for their own use, though, as described more fully in this Privacy Policy, including the section below (under &quot;Publicly Available Information and Apps&quot;), certain information is available to third parties, and we may provide it to third parties, by license or otherwise. The default user settings for all data about you that is visible to others is summarized in our <a href="https://www.thecanaryapp.com/Privacy-FAQ.html">Privacy FAQs</a>, together with information on how to change the default user settings or how to generally remove information, where applicable.</p>

<p>Followers:</p>

<p>Followers on Canary: Your followers can see, for example, your location (as described in more detail below), name, email, profile photo, check-ins and badges, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Canary account), a list of your followers and following, posts/check-ins you write or comment on, and which Canary Services you use.<br class="hidden-xs" />
<br class="hidden-xs" />
Followers and people you follow on Canary: Followers can see your publicly available information and you can see the publicly available information of users you follow, as described below (under &quot;Publicly Available Information and Apps&quot;).<br class="hidden-xs" />
<br class="hidden-xs" />
Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments, posts/check-ins or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Services.</p>

<p>Artists and Their Music: One of the key purposes of the Services is to help users learn about artists, their music/tracks that are relevant to them, and for these entities to provide information about themselves, and their music, as well as to reward users when they check-in their music. When you check-in a particular music your check-in may be shared with that artist. For more info read the <a href="https://www.thecanaryapp.com/Privacy-FAQ.html">Privacy FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>Publicly Available Information and Apps: When you use the Services, certain information is public, such as your public user profile information, likes, comments, posts/check-ins, badges, and lists of followers (as applicable to a particular Service), and may be searchable by search engines and be shared with or disclosed to third parties. We may also share or disclose aggregated and/or anonymous data, such as de-identified check-in data (that does not identify an individual user), to third parties, including users you may follow, for analytical or other purposes.</p>

<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Determining and Sharing Music</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Determining music - The Services deal with music, so in order to work, the Services need to know what music you listen to. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the music information from your mobile device through auto-recognizing, you can search the database of music, or add a music to tailor the Services to your music taste (i.e., we&rsquo;ll show you a list of interesting music that are relevant). This information from is NOT shared with others. Also, the Services send you notifications of your followers, following, interesting music etc.</p>

<p>Sharing music with the Canary app - If you write a post/check-in, like or otherwise interact with a post/check-in, users may infer that you have interacted with that music or post/check-in. Some content, like comments, are time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you posted that comment. Also, if you check-in a music on Canary, it will show your followers that you have checked in that music.</p>

<p>Your Check-in History - Each of your check-ins using the Services is saved to your &quot;Check-in History,&quot; which allows you and your friends to look back at all the music you have checked in since you created your Services account. You can delete any or all of your check-ins from the check-in details page on our website and in the apps. If for some reason you ever decide to delete your Services account, your entire check-in history will be removed from our database.</p>

<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Services Features</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>The Services include several features that may allow you to share your information with others. The <a href="https://www.thecanaryapp.com/Privacy-FAQ.html">Privacy FAQs</a> explain how these features work and describe how you can modify the default settings. Please review them carefully. Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Services, that information may be available to the wider Services community, or may be published on our Sites, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines.</p>

<p>We may provide you with the ability to log into the Service using your existing social media accounts, such as Facebook. We do not control such social media services, your profiles on those services, modify your privacy settings on those services or establish rules about how your information on those services will be used. You and the social media service providers are in control of those issues, not Canary. You are encouraged to read all policies and information on the applicable social media services to learn more about how they handle your information before using any such features made available to you on the Service. We are not responsible for any acts or omissions by any social media service provider or your use of features that come from their platform.</p>

<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Canary and others</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses, provide services to you, sell items or provide promotions to you through the Services. In other situations, Canary provides services, or sells items jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business.</p>

<p>Protection of Canary and Others: We may release your information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Canary, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

If you terminate your account, your profile, including your check-in history, badges you received, and any promotional offers you received, will be removed from the Service and eventually deleted from Canary&rsquo;s servers.
